# walmart-pipeline

This project showcases a complete ETL pipeline designed to analyze Walmart's weekly sales data, focusing on buying trends during holiday periods from 2010 to 2012.

The dataset is extracted directly using the Kaggle API, ensuring automation and reproducibility. Following extraction, the data is cleaned and transformed using Python (Pandas) to prepare it for structured analysis. The transformation includes aggregating average weekly sales by store, enabling analysts to identify seasonal retail patterns.

As part of the pipeline output, a cleaned dataset file is generated and saved, making it easy for analysts to conduct further exploration without repeating the ETL steps. This ensures efficiency and flexibility for additional insights or reporting.
